				<h3>Here's a time line of Dr. Borlaug's life:</h3>
				<ul>
					<li><b>1914</b> - Born in Cresco, Iowa</li>
					<li>
						<b>1933</b>- Leaves his family's farm to attend the
						University of Minnesota, thanks to a Depression era
						program known as the "National Youth Administration"
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>1935</b> - Has to stop school and save up more money.
						Works in the Civilian Conservation Corps, helping
						starving Americans. "I saw how food changed them", he
						said. "All of this left scars on me."
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>1937</b> - Finishes university and takes a job in the
						US Forestry Service
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>1938</b> - Marries wife of 69 years Margret Gibson.
						Gets laid off due to budget cuts. Inspired by Elvin
						Charles Stakman, he returns to school study under
						Stakman, who teaches him about breeding pest-resistent
						plants.
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>1941</b> - Tries to enroll in the military after the
						Pearl Harbor attack, but is rejected. Instead, the
						military asked his lab to work on waterproof glue, DDT
						to control malaria, disinfectants, and other applied
						science.
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>1942</b> - Receives a Ph.D. in Genetics and Plant
						Pathology
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>1944</b> - Rejects a 100% salary increase from
						Dupont, leaves behind his pregnant wife, and flies to
						Mexico to head a new plant pathology program. Over the
						next 16 years, his team breeds 6,000 different strains
						of disease resistent wheat - including different
						varieties for each major climate on Earth.
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>1945</b> - Discovers a way to grown wheat twice each
						season, doubling wheat yields
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>1953</b> - crosses a short, sturdy dwarf breed of
						wheat with a high-yeidling American breed, creating a
						strain that responds well to fertilizer. It goes on to
						provide 95% of Mexico's wheat.
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>1962</b> - Visits Delhi and brings his high-yielding
						strains of wheat to the Indian subcontinent in time to
						help mitigate mass starvation due to a rapidly expanding
						population
					</li>
					<li><b>1970</b> - receives the Nobel Peace Prize</li>
					<li>
						<b>1983</b> - helps seven African countries dramatically
						increase their maize and sorghum yields
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>1984</b> - becomes a distinguished professor at Texas
						A&M Universit
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>2005</b> - states "we will have to double the world
						food supply by 2050." Argues that genetically modified
						crops are the only way we can meet the demand, as we run
						out of arable land. Says that GM crops are not
						inherently dangerous because "we've been genetically
						modifying plants and animals for a long time. Long
						before we called it science, people were selecting the
						best breeds."
					</li>
					<li><b>2009</b> - dies at the age of 95.</li>
